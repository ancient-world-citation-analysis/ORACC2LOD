# Oracc2LoD
Oracc to Linked Open Data: tools and methods (i.e. Jupyter Notebooks) for making Linked Open Data triple statements in Wikidata and FactGrid from ORACC project data (http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/projectlist.html)
All contributions are CC0

The following Jupyter Notebooks are currently in development in the Colab environment. Updates will be added on a regular basis. The resulting datasets can be found in Zenodo.
To replicate any of our results you will need to download and change the file directory path to point to the data in your Google Drive folder. For any questions on how to run any of these, please reach out to Adam Anderson.
