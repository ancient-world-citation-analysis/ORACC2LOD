# Oracc2LoD

## Project Overview

Oracc to Linked Open Data (Oracc2LoD) involves using tools and methods, primarily Jupyter Notebooks, to create Linked Open Data triple statements for platforms such as Wikidata and FactGrid. This project utilizes data from the [ORACC](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/projectlist.html) project to facilitate these transformations.

All contributions to this project are made available under CC0 (public domain dedication).

## Development Environment

The Jupyter Notebooks are currently being developed in the Colab environment. Regular updates are made to ensure the relevance and functionality of the notebooks. The resulting datasets are available on Zenodo for further access and use.

To replicate our results, you will need to download the data and update the file directory paths to point to your data stored in a Google Drive folder. For assistance on running the notebooks or understanding the processes, please reach out to Adam Anderson.
